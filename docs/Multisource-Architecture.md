# Multisource Architecture

- Ingestion: Support multiple sources (direct upload, API, future connectors).
- Replication: Configurable factor across nodes; cross-region (future).
- Consistency: Metadata maps chunks to nodes; retrieve with fallback.
- Observability: Health checks per node; dashboard aggregates status.
- Extensibility: Pluggable storage backends (future roadmap).
